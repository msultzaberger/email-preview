## Configuration

See also the [legacy documentation in the external wiki][].

### Java Properties

Some configuration settings for the Email Preview portlet are managed in Java properties files that
are loaded by a Spring `PropertySourcesPlaceholderConfigurer`.  (Other settings are data, managed in
the "portlet publication record" a.k.a. `portlet-definition.xml` file

The properties files that are sourced by Spring are:

  - `classpath:configuration.properties`
  - `file:${portal.home}/global.properties`
  - `file:${portal.home}/email-preview.properties`

For a definitive, comprehensive list of these settings you must look inside `configuration.properties`.
(This `README` may be incomplete and/or out of date.)

#### The `portal.home` Directory

uPortal version 5 uses a directory called `portal.home` for properties files that live outside of
-- and have the ability to _override_ properties files within-- the webapp in Tomcat.  Please
review the [README file for uPortal-Start][] for more information on this system.

The Notification portlet sources the shared `global.properties` file, as well as it's own (private)
file called `email-preview.properties` in the `portal.home` directory.

#### Using Encrypted Property Values

Within the properties files that are sourced by Spring, you may optionally provide sensitive
configuration items -- such as database passwords -- in encrypted format.  Use the
[Jasypt CLI Tools][] to encrypt the sensitive value, then include it in a `.properties` file
like this:

```
hibernate.connection.password=ENC(9ffpQXJi/EPih9o+Xshm5g==)
```

Specify the encryption key using the `UP_JASYPT_KEY` environment variable.
